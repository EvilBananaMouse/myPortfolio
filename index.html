        <p>Hello world, it is a pleasure to meet you! I am Julian Henry.</p>
        <p>I built this website to display and share my web design projects. I'm a relatively new programmer with
          experience in C++, Java, Python, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. </p>
        <p>I am a senior at Innovation Academy High School planning to pursue a B.S. in computer science. The first
          programming class I took was Middlesex Community College's Intro to Programming class, which made me fall in
          love with the logical challenges coding presents. Since then, the computer science classes I took/am taking
          are AP Computer Science A, Introduction to Quantum Computing, Introduction to Machine Learning, and Web Design
          I. The summer before my senior year, I interned as a teacher assisant in an AP Computer Science class in the
          UC Berekely Academic Talent Development Program.</p>
        <p>I have three years of experience in the service/food industry, working at The Bedford/Burlington Melting Pot
          as a busser, server, host, expediter, kitchen worker, and dishwasher. As a result of my hard work, I recieved
          one of two Employee of the Month awards.</p>
        <p>Outside of school, work, and programming, I love to lift weights, go outside in nature, listen to music, and
          play videogames. Currently, I am replaying Red Dead Redemption 2 and rewatching The Sopranos.</p>
        <p>Thank you so much for visiting my portfolio. Don't forget to check out some of my projects or visit my
          contact page to reach out to me!</p>

          <div id="piTitle">&nbsp;Project Imitation&nbsp;</div>
          <img src="/images/pi.png"><img>
          <p>The goal of this Web Design I project was to create a webpage that was identical to a design in print media
            of our choice using only HTML and CSS, and images sparingly.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="cssZenGarden" onclick=location.href='https://CSS-Zen-Garden-JulianHenry.iacs-wd1-fall-22-23.repl.co'>
          <div id="czgTitle">&nbsp;CSS Zen Garden&nbsp;</div>
          <img src="/images/czg.png"></img>
          <p>For this Web Design I project, my task was to create three distinct designs for an HTML webpage, changing
            only the CSS rules. My themes were Halloween, Cyberpunk, and Construction.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="cyoa" onclick=location.href='https://ChooseYourOwnAdventure-JulianHenry.iacs-wd1-fall-22-23.repl.co'>
          <div id="cyoaTitle">&nbsp;Choose Your Own Adventure&nbsp;</div>
          <img src="/images/cyoa.png"></img>
          <p>In this Web Design I project, I demonstrated my knowledge of HTML pages and links by creating a Choose Your
            Own Adventure website.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="businessCard" onclick=location.href='https://Business-Card-JulianHenry.iacs-wd1-fall-22-23.repl.co'>
          <div id="bcTitle">&nbsp;Business Card&nbsp;</div>
          <img src="/images/bc.png"></img>
          <p>For this Web Design I project, I used four elements of design, constract, repitition, alignment, and
            grouping, to create business cards.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="portfolioProject"
          onclick=location.href='https://Portfolio-Project-JulianHenry.iacs-wd1-fall-22-23.repl.co'>
          <div id="ppTitle">&nbsp;Portfolio Project&nbsp;</div>
          <img src="/images/pp.png"></img>
          <p>In my final Web Design I project, I was tasked with creating a portfolio of my best work in the class.
